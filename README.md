Techniques
Passive gathering
One technique of OSINT gathering is passive gathering. An example of passive gathering would be social media analysis. This happens by scraping public websites such as X, formerly twitter and Instagram. From the data collected from these websites it was searched and organized to consume. 
Keyword Searching
Another form of gathering utilizing OSINT would be keyword searching. Using keyword searching, you have to be specific, use different parts of speech, and use acronyms to name a few things. A workflow that is commonly used is Brainstorm, test, refine/iterate, deploy, then repeat steps 3 and 4 until you approach the search.
Geolocation
One last of many techniques would be geolocation. Utilizing this approach is the process of identifying real world geographic locations of persons, places, or things. This would provide locations of interested targets of entities using OSINT. Some entities that would use this technique are law enforcement, government agencies, and private organizations/investigators.
